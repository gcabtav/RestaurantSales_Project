# RestaurantSales_Project

In this project, I focus on predicting restaurant revenue using machine learning techniques, leveraging demographic, real estate, and commercial data to develop a mathematical model for accurate annual sales forecasts in the restaurant industry. With the industry's competitiveness, data-driven decisions for opening new restaurants are crucial. Currently reliant on subjective judgments, my project addresses this challenge by exploring various machine learning techniques like linear regression, lasso regression, and random forest. These models analyze relationships between input features and annual restaurant sales, allowing for generalization to unseen regional locations. Accurate revenue predictions empower restaurant owners to optimize investments, identify opportunities, and enhance profitability. This project contributes to more informed decision-making in the restaurant industry through advanced data analysis and machine learning, aiming to drive growth and success.
